# GraphServices

A micro-service for graph algorithms.

## Requirements, Limitations, and Usage

Current requirements are that you need the *gods* data-structure library.

```
	go get github.com/deathly809/gods
```

The current server binds to 127.0.0.1 on port 8080.

Currently supports depth first search and breadth first search on the addresses

* 127.0.0.1:8080/dfs
* 127.0.0.1:8080/bfs

The expected json format is generated by the graph data-structure used by *gods*


## TODO

* Create configuration files
* Start working on documentation
* Fixup the JSON to be a little better
* Figure out other stuff todo
